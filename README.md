Community Calendar ~ An Ember Application

The purpose of this application was to create a calendar of events for the poetry community in Portland.  It is an ember application, so there are a few controllers for days and events -- called "interests" in this application.

Although I am pleased with how Ember manages its files and breaks down all the components into routes and models, I find the library limiting.  I'm going to continue this application, but using Angular instead, to see what versatility that library has.
